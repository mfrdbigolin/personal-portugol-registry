# Personal Portugol Registry [![Public license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC0-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

Portugol, also known as Structured  Portuguese, is a Pascal-like Portuguese
pseudocode language; this  was my introduction to programming  logic when I
was eleven years-old in 2015/2016.

This repository is  a personal registry for historical  purposes and covers
all  my code  throught 2016  to  early 2018,  the year  I started  learning
Python; it  is and will  be mantained intact in  a read-only state,  all my
programs were written in Portuguese.
